A discreet live wallpaper of moving wave lines for Android.

You can choose from a number of colors, change if the lines should grow
and shrink or if they should have a uniform width. The lines may swing in
harmony or each line for itself. Further, you may set up the number of
waves in a line or change the maximum amplitude.

I wrote this wallpaper on my phone using AIDE.
