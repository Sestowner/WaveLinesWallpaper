A simple, unobstrusive live wallpaper for Android showing slowly moving
wave lines.

You can choose a color theme, build your own, change if the lines should
grow and shrink or if they should have a uniform width. The lines may swing
in harmony or each line independently. You may set the number of lines, the
number of waves in a line and the maximum amplitude.

I wrote the original version of this wallpaper on my phone using
[AIDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui).
