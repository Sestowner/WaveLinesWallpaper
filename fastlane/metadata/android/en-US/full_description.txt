You can choose a color theme, build your own, change if the lines should
grow and shrink or if they should have a uniform width. The lines may swing
in harmony or each line independently. You may set the number of lines, the
number of waves in a line and the maximum amplitude.

This is open source. If you want to tweak it, just fork it on GitHub:
